# Lab practice time - Lab 10 - GGG 298 WQ 2024

All of the lab materials can be found here: https://github.com/ngs-docs/2024-GGG298.

Some suggestions for activities are below - but you can also revisit any of the old labs and ask questions about parts that have you confused!

* [Lab 1 - Running RStudio and FastQC](https://github.com/ngs-docs/2024-GGG298/blob/main/lab-1.md)
* [Lab 2 - Files, directories, and running programs](https://github.com/ngs-docs/2024-GGG298/blob/main/lab-2.md)
* [Lab 3 - Installing software on remote computers with conda/mamba](https://github.com/ngs-docs/2024-GGG298/blob/main/lab-3.md)
* [Lab 4 - Markdown, HackMD, and GitHub for note taking](https://github.com/ngs-docs/2024-GGG298/blob/main/lab-4.md)
* [Lab 5 - Lab miniproject on sourmash](https://github.com/ngs-docs/2024-GGG298/blob/main/lab-5.md)
* [Lab 6 - Shell scripting, automation, and parallelization](https://github.com/ngs-docs/2024-GGG298/blob/main/lab-6.md)
* [Lab 7 - Automation, parallelization, and snakemake](https://github.com/ngs-docs/2024-GGG298/blob/main/lab-7.md)
* [Lab 8 - snakemake and GitHub](https://github.com/ngs-docs/2024-GGG298/blob/main/lab-8.md)
* [Lab 9 - Quarto & Literate Programming; Slurm and HPC](https://github.com/ngs-docs/2024-GGG298/blob/main/lab-9.md)

## Practice 1: Use git/GitHub to store your automation scripts

Get code from [Lab 6 - Shell scripting, automation, and parallelization](https://github.com/ngs-docs/2024-GGG298/blob/main/lab-6.md), [Lab 7 - Automation, parallelization, and snakemake](https://github.com/ngs-docs/2024-GGG298/blob/main/lab-7.md), and/or [Lab 8 - snakemake and GitHub](https://github.com/ngs-docs/2024-GGG298/blob/main/lab-8.md) working & push to a new github repository.

* create a new github repo
* clone your repo to farm
* add files to the repo
* make sure they run / work properly
* edit files, update what is on github with the edits
* write a nice README file using [Markdown](https://github.com/ngs-docs/2024-GGG298/blob/main/lab-4.md)

## Practice 2: work through the Slurm/HPC tutorial

We didn't get time to do this last week, so work through [the tutorial](https://hackmd.io/p_d88X7HTFSXLmjB0fvuug?view) by yourself or in a group!

## Practice 3: Python and Quarto

Interested in using Python on farm with Quarto?

Work through setting up the Python example using a separate kernel in separate conda environment (see [tutorial](https://github.com/ngs-docs/2024-GGG298/blob/main/lab-9.md)).

## Practice 4: Experiment with RStudio and ondemand

Visit [the ondemand site for farm](https://ondemand.farm.hpc.ucdavis.edu/) with your own account, and experiment with RStudio. You may need to [sign up](https://hippo.ucdavis.edu/Farm/create) for an account first; you can use `datalabgrp` as your host.

* start an RStudio server with the defaults;
* set up your own conda environment containing a version of `r-base`, and then start a new RStudio session in that conda environment
